# com.coralogix.operator.k8smodel

These classes were generated with the default Circe model generator of `guardrail`
from the Kubernetes OpenAPI schema and then modified by hand to better fit
the code generators needs.
It is the `V1` version of the `apiextensions` API.

Ideally these model classes would either be unnecessary (and work in a more dynamic way 
with the CRD YAMLs) or generated by the internal code generator module if that would be
separated from the external one.
