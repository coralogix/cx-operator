These classes were generated with the default Circe model generator of `guardrail`
from the Kubernetes OpenAPI schema and then modified by hand to better fit
the code generators needs.
It is the `V1` version of the `apiextensions` API.

The plan is to split the code generator plugin and use the CRD data types 
generated by the private code generator plugin in the public plugin intended for CRD use.
