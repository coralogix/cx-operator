# com.coralogix.operator.client.model.generated

These classes were generated with the default Circe model generator of `guardrail`
from the Kubernetes OpenAPI schema and then modified by hand to better fit
the code generators needs.

In the future this package should be generated by the k8s client code generator
just like the CRD models.
